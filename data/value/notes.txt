v1 is the original (used to be called v3), got the interaction, had 9 questions
v2 is the replication, didn't get interaction, had 5 questions
v3 is Jonathan's stripped-down version
v4 is the version of v1/v2 that failed.
v5 is Jonathan's explicit-choice-set-question idea.
v6 is the preference reversal.
