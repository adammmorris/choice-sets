My strategy for the 'third letter' question was to ask my self if the letters of the alphabet (in reverse order) came up in any month names.  Example - I asked my self which month had a z, a y, an x...etc, in the month name.  Obviously based on my choice of November, I didn't recall May as I was going through the letters.","1",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2018-11-08 23:39:03","9562"
