October came to mind and I thought that â€œTâ€ was pretty close.  Then I realized that November was probably the best choice.  The points system in part one didnâ€™t really affect my thoughts to my knowledge as I hadnâ€™t figured out the point system.  I also accidentally filled in the second question on â€œdid this month come to mindâ€ on a few that I shouldnâ€™t have.  Please donâ€™t fail me!
