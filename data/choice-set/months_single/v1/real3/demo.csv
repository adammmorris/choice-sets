Once I reached may, I knew no other months have a 'z' in them so I was confident this was the best answer. 

For the first part of the study I tried to think of a mnemonic, numerical relation, or holiday for each. January was 1-12, the range of months. February was five because they both begin with 'F.' March was 6 and I thought 3-6-9. April was 1 for April Fool's Day. May was 2, my significant other is 5'2","0",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2018-11-16 17:21:17","10280"
