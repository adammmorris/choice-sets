Also, on the first part, regardless of what I pushed, either W or P, I was given the 5 points so I didn't really get the chance to earn much of a bonus since it always read that I picked the points - someone had a programming error somewhere.

Regardless strategy was just to learn what the higher scoring ones (over 5) were and then just take the points if it was a word I didn't remember... 

Part 2 I just tried to think of a fair answer and go with it.

Part 1 was brutal having to type the word everytime. ",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"2017-03-24 19:23:53","314"
